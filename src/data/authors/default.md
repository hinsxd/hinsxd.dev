I love <b>TypeScript, React and GraphQL</b>. I build company websites and CMS at work.

I teach highschool Maths, Physics and Japanese. I love to illustrate maths stuff and make simple games in my spare time. I do really enjoy explaining things to people. Maths, Physics, sorting algorithms, React, GraphQL and other stuff. Feeling satisfactory when someone starts to know something because of me.

I like anime, especially Monogatari Series (物語シリーズ, 物語系列). Say hi to Shinobu in the avatar 👋🏻

I started my career as a solo developer / physics tutor in a small tutorial center, after saying yes to help a highschool tutorial teacher of mine, who had no concept of web technologies at all, to help him build a huge platform (by mimicking an existing one). It was a risky, bold and reckless move as I really know nothing about web development at that time. Although, the first project failed, I was able to learn a lot of things by myself and soon I built a simple booking system for the tutorial center with React and GraphQL. I become more confident in my coding skills and soon I landed my second job as a real fullstack developer.

Besides the technologies I use for work on a daily basis, I spent quite a lot of my spare time learning new techs, reading docs and building stuff for fun. I started this blog because I wanted to share my experience in building things with blood, sweat and tears. I hope you will enjoy reading my posts!
