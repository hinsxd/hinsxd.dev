## Explanation

This is a pretty straightforward problem. We have two arrays, one with the scores of the players and one with the scores of the games. We need to return an array with the rank of the player after each game.

<RankVisualizer />

## Solution

```js
function climbingLeaderboard(ranked, player) {
  // Write your code here
  const rankedPoints = ranked.reduce((acc, score) => {
    if (acc.length === 0 || acc[acc.length - 1] !== score) {
      acc.push(score)
    }
    return acc
  }, [])

  // rankedPoints = [100 90 80 75 60]
  // player = [50 65 77 90 102];
  const playerRanks = []

  let rankndex = rankedPoints.length
  let playerIndex = 0

  while (playerIndex < player.length) {
    while (player[playerIndex] >= rankedPoints[rankIndex - 1] && rankIndex > 0) {
      rankIndex--
    }
    playerRanks.push(rankIndex + 1)
    playerIndex++
  }
  return playerRanks
}
```
