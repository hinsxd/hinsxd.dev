# What are bits / bit operations / bitmask?

Computers process data in binary and most programming languages can deal with numbers in binary form natively.

In Javascript or in any other common languages, a number is just a number and no more than a number. Normally all numbers, if not specified, are in base-10.

For example, 19 means nineteen in base 10 and its binary representation is $$10011_2$$ because $$19 = 2^4 + 2^1 + 2^0$$
